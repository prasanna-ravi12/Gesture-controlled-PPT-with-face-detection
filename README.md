# Gesture-controlled-PPT-with-face-detection
"Gesticulation Mapping" combines hand gesture control and facial detection to manage PowerPoint slides securely. Using Python with OpenCV and CVZone, it enables intuitive slide navigation and ensures access only to authorized users through facial recognition.


Project Title: Gesticulation Mapping üñêÔ∏èüìä
Project Overview:
This project enables users to control PowerPoint slides using hand gestures. Additionally, it incorporates face detection to ensure only authorized users can access the presentation.

#### Features üöÄ
- **Hand Gesture Control**: Navigate through slides using predefined hand gestures.
- **Face Detection**: Authenticate users based on facial recognition before granting access to the presentation.

#### Methods Used üõ†Ô∏è
##### Face Detection (`FACE_DETECTION.py`)
The `create_database()` function initializes a database of authorized users by capturing images from the webcam. It uses OpenCV for image processing and face detection using Haar cascades. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:
- **Database Creation**: Captures multiple images of each authorized user's face.
- **Image Processing**: Enhances image contrast using histogram equalization.
- **Face Recognition**: Trains a model using LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) to recognize authorized users during access.

##### Hand Gesture Control (`HAND_GESTURE.py`)
The `HandDetector` module from `cvzone` is used to detect and track hand gestures. Key features include:
- **Gesture Recognition**: Identifies gestures such as left swipe (previous slide) and right swipe (next slide).
- **Annotation**: Allows users to annotate slides using finger gestures.
- **Zooming**: Implements zoom functionality based on hand gestures for detailed slide viewing.

#### Installation üì•
1. pip install numpy cvzone mediapipe


#### Usage üñ•Ô∏è
1. **Face Database Initialization**:
- Run `FACE_DETECTION.py` to create a database of authorized users:
  ```
  python FACE_DETECTION.py
  ```
- Follow the on-screen instructions to capture images for each authorized user.

2. **Presentation Control**:
- Launch the slide control interface using `HAND_GESTURE.py`( will run automatically if user face is recognized):
  ```
  python HAND_GESTURE.py
  ```
- Perform hand gestures in front of the webcam to navigate slides and annotate presentations.
- Control the Presentation:
   - Use hand gestures to navigate through the slides.
   - The following gestures are recognized.
      - All fingers up: Move to the previous slide.
      - All fingers down: Move to the next slide.
      - Index and middle finger up: Draw on the current slide.
      - Index finger up: Start drawing annotations.
      - Three middle fingers up: Remove the last annotation.
